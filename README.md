# Morphological-image-analysis-using-opencv-python
This project performs morphological image analysis using OpenCV in Python to apply operations like erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and skeletonization on a binary image. It evaluates the results against a ground truth using SSIM and IoU metrics to determine the most accurate transformation.
